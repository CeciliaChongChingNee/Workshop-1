## A. PROJECT SUMMARY

**Project Title:**
- e-Cafeteria: Food Ordering and Food Budgeting Application

**Objectives:** 
- To develop and design a cafeteria management system
- To generate budget for customers and sales report for vendors
- To make cafeteria more accessible to individuals in UTeM

## B. ABSTRACT 
e-Cafeteria: Food Ordering and Food Budgeting Application is a system that can improve the current system of UTeMâ€™s cafeteria. This system would allow customers order the daily meals and plan their daily budget. Besides, this system would allow the vendors estimate the quantity of item that need to prepare for every day and calculate their profit easily. Through this system, vendors can know the favourite items and estimate the budget of daily meals for majority customer. It is because all information would be stored in database for easier reference.

## E. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, I have developed the e-cafeteria system. The system is able to help user organize their budget and generate sales report for vendor. This allow for better budget planning and better preparation for daily food preparation. By generating report of daily sales and generating ranking, vendor can better plan their food stock for the next day. By having food preparation, there will be enough to supply everyone even during rush hour. Furthermore, the cafeteria is able to provide delivery service now with the system. This allows for individuals to easily access the cafeteria no matter where they are which will increase the profit of the cafeteria as well.
